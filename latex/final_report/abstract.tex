We believe that the link structure of Wikipedia contains
information that would be useful for geolocation, but hasn't been used so far.
We propose that by using label-propagation algorithms to push geolocation
information around the Wikipedia link graph, we will be able to explore new
possibilities for geolocation, especially locating non-geotagged articles.
Furthermore, the labeling model gives us a way to associate articles with
multiple locations, which would allow bringing in new information about closely-
associated locations. The results of this work could be used  to aid the
traditional IR based geolocation models by providing them  with additional data
to learn their language models from.
