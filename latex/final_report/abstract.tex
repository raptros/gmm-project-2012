We show that the link structure of Wikipedia contains information, which
hasn't been used so far, that is useful for geolocating Wikipedia articles. We
show that by using label propagation algorithms to push geolocation
information around the Wikipedia link graph, we can explore new possibilities
for geolocation, especially locating non-geotagged articles. Furthermore, the
labeling model gives us a way to associate articles with multiple locations,
which allows allow bringing in new information about closely- associated
locations. We believe that the results of this work can be used to aid the
traditional IR based geolocation models by providing them  with additional
data to learn their language models from.
