\section{Conclusion}

Our results suggest that our goal is possible - label propagation does a good
enough job at finding geographic relations from the link structure that it
could plausibly be used to improve the language models of Textgrounder cells.
Specifically, since the recall curve shows that the correct cell assignment is
often among the top scoring labels, label propagation should assign each
document to sensible cells. While further qualitative and quantitative
analysis  will be needed to confirm this potential, we believe further
development  will be worthwhile. With a good label propagation model, and some
development on top of Textgrounder, we expect to be able to add useful
information from more of Wikipedia to geographic grid cells based on the link structure
alone.
