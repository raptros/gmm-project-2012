\section{Conclusion}
Our results suggest that our goal is possible - label propagation does a good 
enough job at finding geographic relations from the link structure that it
could plausibly be used to improve the language models of Textgrounder cells.  
Specifically, since the recall curve shows that the correct cell assignment is 
often among the top scoring labels, label propagation should assign each 
document to sensible cells. While further qualitative and quantitative analysis 
will be needed to confirm this potential, considering that we have not even had 
time to tune the model to improve performance, we believe further development 
will be worthwhile. With a good label propagation model, and some serious 
development on top of Textgrounder, we expect to be able to add useful 
information from more of Wikipedia to geocells based on the link structure 
alone.
